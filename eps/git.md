Objectives

*  Learn a little about version control
*  Learn about cloning a repository
*  Learn a little about creating, pushing, and pulling


Clone an existing repository

First, we are going to clone a repository. This means that we download and set up a link with an existing repository. It also means that we can pull all the changes made in it to our local machine. 

```
   git clone https://github.com/textcreationpartnership/Texts.git

```

This fetches the Texts repository from the *textcreationpartnership* project and creates it on our machine in its own directory. 

Setting up a repository

```
   git init
```

Pull


```
    git pull
```

Push

```
    git push
```
